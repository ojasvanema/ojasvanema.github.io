Hi, I'm **Ojasva**.

I am an undergraduate at **IIT Roorkee** . My work revolves around **Deep Generative Models**, **Mechanistic Interpretability**, and **Large Language Models**.

Currently, my work is focused on **Mechanistic Interpretability**. I am an active member of the **Data Science Group (DSG)**, a student club on campus. I lead a research squad within the club, investigating LLM internals. We recently published work on how models route domain knowledge (check our [website](#)).


Simultaneously, I work at the **P-square Lab** with [Prof. Parikshit Pareek](https://www.iitr.ac.in/~EE/Parikshit_Pareek). We are currently investigating **Bilinear MLPs** to find more interpretable architectures and building a **foundation model for amortized kernel hyperparameter discovery**. We also recently finalized a **Sparse Diffusion** framework for high-energy physics (CERN).

Previously, I worked on **Image Alchemy**, a personalization method for diffusion models that I published at **ICLR 2025**.

Beyond the lab, I recently gained real-world experience at **Elimentary**, where I engineered local LLM APIs and evaluation pipelines.


Always happy to chat about circuits, LLMs or what’s next in AI!
