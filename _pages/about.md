Hi, I'm **Ojasva**.

I am an undergraduate at **IIT Roorkee** . My work revolves around **Deep Generative Models**, **Mechanistic Interpretability**, and **Large Language Models**.

Currently, my work is focused on **Mechanistic Interpretability**. I am an active member of the [Data Science Group (DSG)](https://dsgiitr.in/), a student club on campus. I lead a small research squad within the club, investigating LLM internals. We recently [published work](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ymkZZ2y8Pl-0b81q2B_VH-egtbpZTrB2/view) on how models route domain knowledge (check our [website](https://inside-llms.gitbook.io/surgical-domain-discovery)).


Simultaneously, I work at the [P-square Lab](https://psquare-lab.github.io/) with Prof. Parikshit Pareek. We are currently investigating **Bilinear MLPs** to find more interpretable architectures and building a **foundation model for amortized kernel hyperparameter discovery**. We also recently finalized a [Sparse Diffusion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gd-tJp-8napvR_qcfLp3wWk1FNH72SFo/view?usp=drive_link) framework for high-energy physics(CERN).

Previously, I worked on [Image Alchemy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10743), a personalization method for diffusion models that I published at **ICLR DeLTa workshop 2025**.
Beyond the lab, I recently gained real-world experience at [Elimentary](https://elimentary.com/), where I engineered local LLM APIs and evaluation pipelines.

Off the clock, I’m usually reading about finance (I’m always open to book recommendations!) or watching anime.

Always happy to chat about circuits, LLMs or what’s next in AI!
(And seriously, what would *you* do if you had infinite compute?)
