Hi, I am Ojasva, a junior undergraduate at [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), majoring in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Deep Generative Models**, **Mechanistic Interpretability**, and **Large Language Models**.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant working with [Prof. Parikshit Pareek](https://www.iitr.ac.in/~EE/Parikshit_Pareek) at the Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Roorkee. My work focuses on designing sparsity-aware **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** for modeling ultra-sparse data in high-energy physics detectors. We are introducing weighted loss functions to stabilize training and building physics-informed generative frameworks.

I am also an active member of the [Data Science Group, IIT Roorkee](https://dsgiitr.in/).

Previously, I have worked on:
*   **Domain Circuit Discovery in LLMs**: Investigating how LLMs represent and process diverse domain knowledge using mechanistic interpretability techniques.
*   **Survival Analysis**: Predicting survival probability for colon cancer patients using ML models like Cox Proportional Hazards Regression and Random Survival Forests.

Outside of research, I enjoy exploring new technologies and working on open-source projects.
