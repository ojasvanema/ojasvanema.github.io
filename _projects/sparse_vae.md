This research focuses on modeling ultra-sparse data from high-energy physics detectors.

**Key Contributions:**
*   Designed a **sparsity-aware Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** for modeling data with only 0.2% active pixels.
*   Introduced a **weighted loss** to stabilize training, reduce artifacts, and preserve detector features.
*   Built a **physics-informed generative framework** reproducing realistic detector sparsity.
*   Extending work to sparse power flow datasets to demonstrate model generalizability.
*   Targeting submission to **ICML 2026**.
