**Mechanistic Interpretability Project**

This project investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) internally represent and process diverse domain knowledge.

**Key Contributions:**
*   Pinpointed component roles using probing, adaptation analysis, and causal swaps.
*   Found that **attention routes domain identity** while **MLPs store domain-specific logic**.
*   Submitted to **ICLR 2026 main conference**.
